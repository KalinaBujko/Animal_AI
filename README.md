#Animal_AI

This is a simulation of a simple animal ecosystem built in **Unreal Engine 5**, featuring dynamic AI behavior for both predators and herbivores.

##Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore naturalistic AI systems through a small ecosystem simulation.  
The two main species — **hippos** and **lions** — behave differently based on internal states and environmental interactions.

NPCs are controlled by **custom state machines** with behaviors such as:

- Idle
- Roaming
- Eating
- Resting
- Running
- Combat (in case of aggression)

Predators detect nearby prey and attack, while herbivores like hippos either run or defend themselves based on their gender.
